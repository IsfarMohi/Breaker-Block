# MOHI BREAKER

## Description

This project is a learning exercise based on an existing project using Pygame. It is not my original work but rather a copy made to understand and learn from the implementation and documentation provided by the original creator.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is educational. By replicating the original project, I aim to:
- Understand the underlying concepts and technologies used.
- Gain hands-on experience with Pygame.
- Improve my coding skills by studying and implementing the code.

## Original Project

The original project was created by another developer. All credit for the original project goes to them. Their documentation and code have been invaluable in my learning process.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
